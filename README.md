### Addressing Food Insecurity Among UBC Students

With rising food costs on and around campus, many UBC students **struggle to find affordable, nutritious meals**, negatively impacting their academic performance and overall well-being. Despite the availability of **numerous campus events offering free food**, students often remain unaware of these opportunities. 

This **lack of information** means that:
- Students miss out on potential meals
- Food from these events may go to waste

UBC provides a food bank, but its use may feel **intimidating** for some students. Commercial options, like *Too Good To Go*, offer limited relief with **inconsistent quality and availability**. 

---

### The Challenge

**How can we create an accessible system that:**
1. Connects students with **real-time, reliable information** about free food events?
2. Helps **reduce food waste** while supporting students in need?

Creating such a system could enhance students' well-being and alleviate some of the food security challenges on campus.
